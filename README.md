Trouble with this Email Template
I am trying to edit a template that I had purchased to work for our needs.  This is one of my first attempts at html, so pardon the mess of mistakes I likely made.  I have one issue that I cannot seem to fix.  On line 580 I cannot get the formatting of the text to appear as ##### Name.  It autoformats to Name ##### even though it appears typed correctly in the markup.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
